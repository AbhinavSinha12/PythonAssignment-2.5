Assignment 2.5

Problem Statement 1: 
Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers representing the lengths of the 
corresponding words. 

Hint: â€‹If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4] 
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.


def find_wordlength(wordlist):
    listlen = list()
    for word in wordlist:
        listlen.append(len(word))
        
    return listlen

print(find_wordlength([ "ab","cde","erty"]))


Problem Statement 2: Write a Python function which takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True 
if it is a vowel, False otherwise.

def find_vowel(c):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    if(c in vowels):
        return True
    else:
        return False

find_vowel('k')
